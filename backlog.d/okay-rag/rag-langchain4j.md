- [ ] rag-langchain4j — their EmbeddingStore as a Retrieve handler
      (the other half of the interop sentence; when a consumer
      names a store)
      PARTIAL 2026-09-02: the EmbeddingModel half landed as
      okay-langchain4j-embed (a local ONNX embedder, String =>
      Embedding + Handler[Embed] — MemoryMatch's exact `embed` seam,
      no okay-rag pipeline needed). Deliberately OUT of okay-demo's
      build and the root aggregate (a real ~90MB model download).
      The EmbeddingStore/VectorStore half named in the title is
      still open — this box stays unchecked for that.
