/**
 * A handler (Plotkin & Pretnar's sense, level 1, specs/api-levels.md): a VALUE that takes the effect `E` off
 * any program's row and answers `O[A]` — `p.handle(State(5))`, `p.handle(State(5)).handle(Throws.either).run`.
 * `Handler[E, O]` is the usual one: any answer, nothing needed of the rest of the row. `Handler.Full` bounds the
 * answer by `I` and needs `Needs[F]` of the rest `F` (`Reset[R]`: the answer is `R`, the rest's `Nesting`).
 * An answer per operation and no more, the old `Handler[F]`, is `Answers[F]`.
