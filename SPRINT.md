# Sprint

## Doing
- generalized-method-syntax — Scala 3's multiple type parameter clauses
  (operator, 2026-09-11). Three stages: `split`/`over`/`<|>` lose their
  second-stage value classes; the row combinators take rows first and
  infer the answer types; `State.handle[Int](0)(p)`. Probed on 3.9.0
  first — same bytecode, and a row infers from a program but widens
  from a single operation. Claimed 2026-09-11
  (.work/active/generalized-method-syntax.claim).
- dataflow — our own distributed engine (specs/dataflow.md). Stage 0
  (the spec) and stage 1 (the plan as a value + the local runtime)
  have LANDED, and so has stage 2 (the exchange, with the crossover
  measured at ~100 000 accumulators — and DECLINED on the Wrocław
  job, correctly), and so has stage 3 (one pass, many sinks). The
  engine's number against the hand-written lane went 5.5x -> **1.14x**
  with `dataflow-complete-panes`: a partition now finishes every pane
  no other partition can touch, so 122 679 accumulators reach the
  coordinator where ~2.9 million did. Next: `dataflow-run-complete-panes`
  (the single-stage road did not get the rule and is now 7.6x behind
  the fan), `dataflow-fan-overhead` (a third of the fan's time is in
  none of its sinks). STAGE 4 IS DONE: the engine runs across four
  real processes, jobs by name, partials by Schema. Next is stage 5,
  failure — a worker that dies takes the run with it today.

## Queue
(the note that stood here named eight candidates; SIX have since
 landed — sql-pg-wire, lake-read-duckdb, jdbc-write-bridge,
 rag-pgvector, persist-wire, cache-memory, each with a CHANGELOG
 entry — and `mcp-resumable-sse` exists in neither board any more.
 Checked and rewritten 2026-09-09; a queue that names finished work
 sends the next agent looking for it. `ui-durable` survives only as a
 mention inside another BACKLOG entry, not as an item of its own.

 Open and named, for whoever picks next: json-strict-is-now-the-slow-door
 (likely a wontfix — its entry states the disqualifying condition),
 scan-into-the-other-scanners (Yaml/Markdown/Xml/Code still answer the
 pair; wants a measured lane before the conversion).
 scan-step-allocation LANDED 2026-09-10 — the sink road took 29% of
 lexing's allocation, and the arithmetic that predicted a fifth is in
 its CHANGELOG entry.
 lexer-buf-without-concat is GONE from this list: it landed 64d7af6a
 as a refutation (the array candidate measured 11-12% WORSE), which
 also prices what scan-step-allocation was waiting for.
 bracket-over-region is ANSWERED (bracket-pairing, 4651c126): it was
 an unpaired comparison, the crossover is at one operation inside the
 scope, and there is nothing to fix)

## Backlog gate
Promote from BACKLOG.md when the sprint empties; a task enters the
sprint only with a spec section it implements.
