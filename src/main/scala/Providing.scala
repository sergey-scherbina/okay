/**
 * The COMPOSABLE half of provide (specs/context-functions.md, E16):
 * where `provide(a, b)(body)` is flat and capped at 22, `providing`
 * builds installers as VALUES and composes them applicatively —
 * no nesting, no cap.
 *
 * {{{
 *   val base = providing[Db](db) and providing[Log](log)
 *   (base and providing[Clock](clock)) { app }   // app(using Db, Log, Clock)
 * }}}
 *
 * The mechanism is currying as composition of type constructors:
 * one installer carries `F[X] = A ?=> X`; `and` composes to
 * `F[G[X]] = A ?=> G[X]` — the curried chain `A ?=> B ?=> X`
 * assembled by values. Type lambdas reduce where the match-type
 * route (E11/E12) stalls, so a using-method eta-expands into the
 * chain at the call site. Nesting order: the RIGHT operand of
 * `and` is the inner layer, so it wins under nearest-wins (E8) —
 * `base and providing[Log](testLog)` overrides base's Log.
 *
 * Prefer the explicit type argument, `providing[Db](db)`: inference
 * would pick the runtime refinement, and the capability you install
 * is the trait, not the anonymous class.

/**
 * The CONSUMER one-liner (E17): `wire[Db].q` pulls the ambient
 * capability by naming its type — Reader's `ask` on context
 * functions. The naive `def wire[T] = summon[T]` does not compile
 * (no given at the definition site); the `A ?=> A` result type is
 * the fix, and the eager auto-application of context functions
 * (the E10 trap) works FOR us here: in receiver position
 * `wire[Db].q` applies to the nearest given and moves on. Doors
 * write point-free: `val getQ: Db ?=> String = wire[Db].q`.
 * A missing given is a compile error — the DI claim holds.
